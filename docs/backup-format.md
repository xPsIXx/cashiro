# Backup & Restore Format

PennyWise exports the full local database + user preferences to a single JSON
file and can restore it later, on the same or a newer app version. This
document is the **contract** for that format: how it stays compatible across
versions, and the rules you must follow when you change anything it touches.

> TL;DR: every backup-serialized field **must have a Kotlin default value**.
> That single rule is what makes old backups restorable forever. A CI test
> (`BackupSchemaGuardTest`) enforces it twice: once for the wrapper models, and
> once against a pinned required-fields baseline for every Room entity — so an
> entity that gains a new non-defaulted column fails CI too.

## Where it lives

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `data/backup/BackupModels.kt` | The wrapper schema (`PennyWiseBackup`, `DatabaseSnapshot`, `PreferencesSnapshot`, …). All `@Serializable`, all fields defaulted. |
| `data/backup/BackupSerializers.kt` | The `backupJson` instance + custom serializers for `BigDecimal` / `LocalDate` / `LocalDateTime`. The one source of truth for serialization behavior. |
| `data/backup/BackupExporter.kt` | Reads the DB → builds `PennyWiseBackup` → `backupJson.encodeToString`. |
| `data/backup/BackupImporter.kt` | `backupJson.decodeFromString` → inserts into the DB (MERGE or REPLACE_ALL), remapping foreign keys and skipping bad rows. |
| `data/database/entity/*.kt` | The Room entities are serialized **directly** (each is `@Serializable`). |
| `test/.../backup/BackupModelsTest.kt` | Round-trip + backward/forward compatibility regression tests. |
| `test/.../backup/BackupSchemaGuardTest.kt` | CI guard: every wrapper-model field has a default. |

## The compatibility contract

The backup is (de)serialized with **kotlinx.serialization**, configured in
`BackupSerializers.kt` to be tolerant in both directions:

- **Backward compatible** (old backup → newer app): a key the older app didn't
  write is simply **missing**. Because every field has a Kotlin default,
  kotlinx fills the default instead of throwing. `coerceInputValues = true`
  also turns a present-but-`null` value on a defaulted field into the default.
- **Forward compatible** (new backup → older app): a key the newer app added is
  **unknown** to the older app. `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` drops it silently.

This is why the historic bug (issue #414) happened and why it's now fixed:
the old code used **Gson**, which constructs objects with
`Unsafe.allocateInstance` and **ignores Kotlin default values entirely**. An
older backup missing a newer non-null column (e.g. `subscription.billingCycle`,
`subscription.direction`) deserialized that field as `null` under a non-null
type, and the insert then crashed — aborting the whole restore. kotlinx honors
the defaults, so the same backup now restores cleanly.

### Wire-format details (do not change without a version bump)

The custom serializers emit **byte-identical** output to the legacy Gson
adapters, so backups remain readable across the Gson→kotlinx switch in both
directions:

| Type | JSON representation |
|------|---------------------|
| `BigDecimal` | plain decimal string, `toPlainString()` (e.g. `"499.00"`) |
| `LocalDateTime` | `ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME` string (e.g. `"2024-01-02T10:15:30"`) |
| `LocalDate` | `ISO_LOCAL_DATE` string (e.g. `"2024-01-02"`) |
| enums | the constant **name** (e.g. `"EXPENSE"`) |
| entity field keys | the Kotlin **property name** (camelCase, e.g. `merchantName`) |
| wrapper-model keys | explicit `@SerialName` (snake_case, e.g. `merchant_mappings`) |

Format string lives in `PennyWiseBackup.CURRENT_FORMAT` (`"PennyWise Backup v1.2"`).
Imports accept any `PennyWiseBackup.COMPATIBLE_PREFIX` (`"PennyWise Backup v1"`).

## Resilience

Beyond schema tolerance, the importer skips and **counts** any single row that
fails to insert (`insertEachCounting`) instead of letting it abort the whole
restore. This is applied to **every** entity insert loop in both `MERGE` and
`REPLACE_ALL` (and the merge helpers); batch snapshot inserts are wrapped in a
table-level `try/catch`. The skipped count surfaces to the user ("N rows could
not be imported"). This guards against genuinely corrupt rows or constraint
violations — schema drift is already handled upstream by the defaults.

The one deliberate exception is `importProfilesAndBuildMap`: its inserts build
the profile id-remap map that transactions/balances depend on, so it stays
strict (a profile failure should surface, not be silently swallowed).

## How to change the format safely

### Adding a column to an existing entity
1. Add the column to the entity **with a Kotlin default** and a Room
   `defaultValue` (Room migration as usual). The default is mandatory — without
   it, older backups that lack the key become un-importable.
   ```kotlin
   @ColumnInfo(name = "new_flag", defaultValue = "0")
   val newFlag: Boolean = false   // <-- the default is load-bearing
   ```
2. If the field type is `BigDecimal` / `LocalDate` / `LocalDateTime`, mark it
   `@Contextual`. If it's an enum, make the enum `@Serializable`.
3. Done — no importer change needed. Add an assertion to the round-trip test if
   it carries meaningful data.

### Adding a whole new entity / table to the backup
1. Make the entity `@Serializable` (+ `@Contextual` on special-typed fields,
   `@Serializable` on its enums).
2. Add a `List<NewEntity> = emptyList()` field to `DatabaseSnapshot` (with a
   `@SerialName`).
3. Populate it in `BackupExporter` and insert it in `BackupImporter`
   (mind foreign-key ordering — parents before children).
4. Add a stat counter to `BackupStatistics` (defaulted to `0`).

### Adding a field to a wrapper model
Always give it a default. `BackupSchemaGuardTest` fails the build otherwise.

### Things you must NOT do
- ❌ Remove a default from any backup-serialized field.
- ❌ Rename an entity property without keeping the old JSON key (a rename
  silently drops that data from older backups — they still carry the old key).
  If you must rename, add `@SerialName("oldKey")` to preserve it.
- ❌ Change a `BigDecimal`/date/enum's wire representation.
- ❌ Add a non-defaulted field to a wrapper model.

## Testing

`BackupModelsTest` covers round-trip, the loans/groups regression (#386), the
#414 backward-compat regression (`oldBackupMissingNewerFields_*`), forward-compat
(`newerBackupWithUnknownKeys_isIgnored`), missing sections, and null coercion.

`BackupSchemaGuardTest` enforces the compatibility invariant on two layers:
- **wrapper models** — every field must have a default; and
- **entities** — the set of *required* (non-defaulted) fields is pinned to a
  baseline (`KNOWN_REQUIRED_ENTITY_FIELDS`). Adding a new non-defaulted field to
  any backed-up entity — the exact #414 footgun — grows that set and fails the
  build, telling you to add a default (or, rarely, update the baseline for a
  field guaranteed present in every existing backup).

Run them:
```bash
./gradlew :app:testStandardDebugUnitTest --tests "com.pennywiseai.tracker.data.backup.*"
```

When you touch the backup format, **add a regression test that decodes an
older-shaped JSON fixture** (a raw string missing your new key) and asserts the
default is applied — that's the only thing that protects real users' old files.
