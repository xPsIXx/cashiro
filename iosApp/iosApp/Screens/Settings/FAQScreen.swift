                            answer: "Wallet transactions (Google Pay, PhonePe, etc.) are marked as Credit because they're charged to your bank account or credit card first, not direct bank debits. The actual bank debit is a separate transaction."

                            answer: "Use Transfer when moving money between your own accounts (e.g., savings to checking). Transfers don't affect your net worth. Use Expense for actual spending where money leaves your possession."

                            answer: "Manual accounts let you track cash, investments, or any accounts where you update balances yourself. They're great for tracking spending that doesn't go through a bank."

Add the \"Open URLs\" action and enter pennywise://add\n3. Name it something like \"Add expense\"\n4. Go to Settings › Accessibility › Touch › Back Tap\n5. Choose Double Tap or Triple Tap, then pick your shortcut\n\nNow a double tap on the back of your phone opens the Add Transaction screen."
